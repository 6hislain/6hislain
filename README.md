# Hi there :wave:, welcome to my Github profile
My name is _Mugemana Michael Ghislain_ - I am currently pursuing a degree in software engineering. I started coding out of curiosity, nowadays I focus on web development. My coding journey started with _WordPress_ and _PhpBB_, later on I decided to move onto something more challenging.

## :sunglasses: What can I do?
So far I've tried a number of frameworks, and I am very comfortable with:

### 1. Laravel

> What I like about Laravel
- Full stack development framework - comes bundled with _Eloquent ORM_, _Blade template engine_...
- Integrates easily with _Vue_ or _React_
- Excellent documentation

### 2. MEVN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Vue, NodeJs)

> What I like about the MEVN Stack
- REST API with _Express_ and _GraphQl_
- VueJs' clear syntax - easy to understand
- Quick project scaffolding

## What I am learning
Currently I am trying to learn _Electron_
