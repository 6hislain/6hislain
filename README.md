# Hello there :wave:, welcome to my GitHub profile
My name is Mugemana Michael Ghislain; I am an aspiring full stack developer with a particular interest in Node.js. I spend my free time on web development tweaking small projects. So far, I am comfortable working with the following stacks:

## 1. MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React & Node.js)
At first, I had a hard time structuring my Node projects until I stumbled upon a Udemy course - then things started coming into place. In the process, I learned different things such as;

- Singe Page Apps (React & Vue)
- Express REST & GraphQL APIs
- JWT authentication
- ORM (Sequelize & Mongoose)
- Socket.io

## 2. Laravel
I started using PHP while working with WordPress and other CMSs. Later on, a friend introduced me to Laravel. My takeaway on Laravel:

- Extensive community support & documentation
- Preinstalled tools (ORM, templating engine, SASS, Vue.js)
- Rigid project structure

## 3. CodeIgniter
I came across CodeIgniter while looking for a lightweight & fast alternative to Laravel, with fewer configurations and quick project setup. Nonetheless, It shares a lot of similarities with Laravel in terms of route definition, controllers, and views.
